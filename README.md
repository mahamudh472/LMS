# Library  Management System (E-library)

To Let readers know avaliable books. Easily found books by searching this web application has been created. This application is based on our institute "Dinajpur Polytechnic Institute". 

Inspiration: Our institute has a big library with huge collection of books but for some reason the students are not allowed to enter book area. New members or normal students have to ask the librarian for book and he will provide if available. I observed that because of the process most of the students don't try to get books from library instead they just use the library reading tables. To solve this issue, me and my friend make this plan. All available books will be listed in this web appllication and anyone can see how many books available and the books anyone borrowed, when he will return the book. This is the main reason  of this project.
